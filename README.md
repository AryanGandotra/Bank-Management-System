# Bank-Management-System

A Bank Management System is a software application developed using Java programming language with a SQL database that allows users to perform various banking operations. With a user-friendly interface created using Java Swing, users can create new accounts, check their balances, and perform other transactions.

New users can register for an account by providing their personal information and creating a unique login ID and password. Once the account is created, users can log in and view their account balance and transaction history.

The Bank Management System allows users to deposit, withdraw, and transfer funds between accounts. Users can also view their account statement and transaction history to keep track of their financial activity.
